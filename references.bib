               sequencing present challenges to ecological and statistical
               interpretation. In particular, library sizes often vary over
               several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeros.
               Although we are typically interested in comparing relative
               abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can
               only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained
               from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative
               abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of
               taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a
               special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of
               taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1,
               these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are
               constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained
               in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are
               not applicable. Here, we evaluate how these challenges impact
               the performance of existing normalization methods and
               differential abundance analyses. Results Effects on
               normalization: Most normalization methods enable successful
               clustering of samples according to biological origin when the
               groups differ substantially in their overall microbial
               composition. Rarefying more clearly clusters samples according
               to biological origin than other normalization techniques do for
               ordination metrics based on presence or absence. Alternate
               normalization measures are potentially vulnerable to artifacts
               due to library size. Effects on differential abundance testing:
               We build on a previous work to evaluate seven proposed
               statistical methods using rarefied as well as raw data. Our
               simulation studies suggest that the false discovery rates of
               many differential abundance-testing methods are not increased by
               rarefying itself, although of course rarefying results in a loss
               of sensitivity due to elimination of a portion of available
               data. For groups with large (~10$\times$) differences in the
               average library size, rarefying lowers the false discovery rate.
               DESeq2, without addition of a constant, increased sensitivity on
               smaller datasets (20 samples per group) but also critically the
               only method tested that has a good control of false discovery
               rate. Conclusions These findings guide which normalization and
               differential abundance techniques to use based on the data
               characteristics of a given study.",

               part due to scarce resources, facilities, and the difficulty of
               fresh or frozen stool storage/transport. Here, we aimed (1) to
               establish a broad representation of diverse developing countries
               (Argentina, Chile, India, and Vietnam); (2) to validate a
               `resource-light' sample-collection protocol translatable in
               these settings using guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT)
               cards stored and, importantly, shipped internationally at room
               temperature; (3) to perform initial profiling of the collective
               CRC-associated microbiome of these developing countries; and (4)
               to compare this quantitatively with established CRC biomarkers
               from developed countries. Methods We assessed the effect of
               international storage and transport at room temperature by
               replicating gFOBT from five UK volunteers, storing two in the
               UK, and sending replicates to institutes in the four countries.
               Next, to determine the effect of prolonged UK storage, DNA
               extraction replicates for a subset of samples were performed up
               to 252 days apart. To profile the CRC-associated microbiome of
               developing countries, gFOBT were collected from 41
               treatment-na{\"\i}ve CRC patients and 40 non-CRC controls from
               across the four institutes, and V4 16S rRNA gene sequencing was
               performed. Finally, we constructed a random forest (RF) model
               that was trained and tested against existing datasets from
               developed countries. Results The microbiome was stably assayed
               when samples were stored/transported at room temperature and
               after prolonged UK storage. Large-scale microbiome structure was
               separated by country and continent, with a smaller effect from
               CRC. Importantly, the RF model performed similarly to models
               trained using external datasets and identified similar taxa of
               importance (Parvimonas, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium,

               that gFOBT, stored and transported at room temperature,
               represents a suitable method of faecal sample collection for
               amplicon-based microbiome biomarkers in developing countries and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence reveals the importance of the
              microbiome in health and disease and inseparable host-microbial
              dependencies. Host-microbe interactions are highly relevant in
              patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
              transplantation (HSCT), i.e., a replacement of the cellular
              components of the patients' immune system with that of a foreign
              donor. HSCT is employed as curative immunotherapy for a number of
              non-malignant and malignant hematologic conditions, including
              cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The procedure can
              be accompanied by severe side effects such as infections, acute
              graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), and death. Here, we performed
              a longitudinal analysis of immunological markers, immune
              reconstitution and gut microbiota composition in relation to
              clinical outcomes in children undergoing HSCT. Such an analysis
              could reveal biomarkers, e.g., at the time point prior to HSCT,
              that in the future could be used to predict which patients are of
              high risk in relation to side effects and clinical outcomes and
              guide treatment strategies accordingly. RESULTS: In two
              multivariate analyses (sparse partial least squares regression
              and canonical correspondence analysis), we identified three
              consistent clusters: (1) high concentrations of the antimicrobial
              peptide human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) prior to the transplantation
              in patients with high abundances of Lactobacillaceae, who later
              developed moderate or severe aGvHD and exhibited high mortality.
              (2) Rapid reconstitution of NK and B cells in patients with high
              abundances of obligate anaerobes such as Ruminococcaceae, who
              developed no or mild aGvHD and exhibited low mortality. (3) High
              inflammation, indicated by high levels of C-reactive protein, in
              patients with high abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria
              such as Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, we observed that
              antibiotic treatment influenced the bacterial community state.
              CONCLUSIONS: We identify multivariate associations between
              specific microbial taxa, host immune markers, immune cell
              reconstitution, and clinical outcomes in relation to HSCT. Our
              findings encourage further investigations into establishing
              longitudinal surveillance of the intestinal microbiome and
              relevant immune markers, such as hBD2, in HSCT patients.

              that could help identify patients at risk of poor immune
              reconstitution and adverse outcomes, such as aGvHD and death,

               that skin bacterial communities are personalized, we

              climate through radiation absorption, light scattering, or acting

              variables on the bioaerosol composition in the Amazon rainforest.

              the Amazon rainforest during distinct seasons and at different

              There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based
              representations in the brain, and certain computational theories
              of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is
              known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of
              objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix
              factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic
              features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as
              principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn
              holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix
              factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use
              of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a
              parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not
              subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization
              is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations
              emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons
              are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.",

              visualization of these data requires dimensionality reduction. To
              date, the most commonly used method for dimensionality reduction
              in the microbiome is calculation of between-sample microbial
              differences (beta diversity), followed by principal-coordinate
              analysis (PCoA). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
              (UMAP) is an alternative method that can reduce the
              dimensionality of beta diversity distance matrices. Here, we
              demonstrate the benefits and limitations of using UMAP for
              dimensionality reduction on microbiome data. Using real data, we
              demonstrate that UMAP can improve the representation of clusters,
              especially when the clusters are composed of multiple subgroups.
              Additionally, we show that UMAP provides improved correlation of
              biological variation along a gradient with a reduced number of
              coordinates of the resulting embedding. Finally, we provide
              parameter recommendations that emphasize the preservation of

              routinely used as a complementary visualization method for

              method to visualize microbiome data. The method is extensible to

              provide evidence that horseshoes arise as a consequence of
              distance metrics that saturate-a familiar concept in other fields

              diseases. However, in the majority of studies the effects of FMT
              were evaluated on the patients with initially altered microbiota.
              The aim of our study was to estimate effects of FMT on the gut
              microbiota composition in healthy volunteers and to monitor its
              long-term outcomes. RESULTS: We have performed a combined
              analysis of three healthy volunteers before and after capsule FMT
              by evaluating their general condition, adverse clinical effects,
              changes of basic laboratory parameters, and several immune
              markers. Intestinal microbiota samples were evaluated by 16S rRNA
              gene and shotgun sequencing. The data analysis demonstrated
              profound shift towards the donor microbiota taxonomic composition
              in all volunteers. Following FMT, all the volunteers exhibited
              gut colonization with donor gut bacteria and persistence of this
              effect for almost ∼1 year of observation. Transient changes of
              immune parameters were consistent with suppression of T-cell
              cytotoxicity. FMT was well tolerated with mild gastrointestinal
              adverse events, however, one volunteer developed a systemic
              inflammatory response syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The FMT leads to
              significant long-term changes of the gut microbiota in healthy
              volunteers with the shift towards donor microbiota composition
              and represents a relatively safe procedure to the recipients
              without long-term adverse events.",

               Here we show that chronic inflammation and fibrosis in humans
               and mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is accompanied
               by accumulation of liver-resident immunoglobulin-A-producing
               (IgA+) cells. These cells also express programmed death ligand 1
               (PD-L1) and interleukin-10, and directly suppress liver
               cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, which prevent emergence of
               hepatocellular carcinoma and express a limited repertoire of
               T-cell receptors against tumour-associated antigens. Whereas
               CD8+ T-cell ablation accelerates hepatocellular carcinoma,
               genetic or pharmacological interference with IgA+ cell
               generation attenuates liver carcinogenesis and induces cytotoxic
               T-lymphocyte-mediated regression of established hepatocellular
               carcinoma. These findings establish the importance of
               inflammation-induced suppression of cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte
               activation as a tumour-promoting mechanism. Cancer progression
               beyond the early stages is thought to be caused in some cases by
               adaptive immunity, but its role remains controversial. In this
               study, Michael Karin and colleagues show that PD-L1-expressing
               IgA+ B cells accumulate in the inflamed livers of humans and

              differentiation of closely related bacteria. Although many
              scientific questions can be addressed with broad taxonomic

              require higher specificity. Here we introduce a novel
              sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, Deblur, that uses
              error profiles to obtain putative error-free sequences from
              Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing platforms. Deblur
              substantially reduces computational demands relative to similar
              sOTU methods and does so with similar or better sensitivity and
              specificity. Using simulations, mock mixtures, and real data
              sets, we detected closely related bacterial sequences with single
              nucleotide differences while removing false positives and
              maintaining stability in detection, suggesting that Deblur is
              limited only by read length and diversity within the amplicon
              sequences. Because Deblur operates on a per-sample level, it
              scales to modern data sets and meta-analyses. To highlight
              Deblur's ability to integrate data sets, we include an
              interactive exploration of its application to multiple distinct
              sequencing rounds of the American Gut Project. Deblur is open

@ARTICLE{Greig-Smith1980-pt,
  title     = "The development of numerical classification and ordination",
  author    = "Greig-Smith, P",
  abstract  = "The paper reviews the constraints and influences which have
               affected the development of numerical classification and
               ordination of vegetation. Initial development of ordination
               techniques and their reception by ecologists was hindered by the
               mistaken idea that ordination involved acceptance of variation
               in vegetation as a continuum, as well as by a general suspicion
               of mathematical approaches. Three distinct approaches to
               ordination, largely unrecognised at the time, are apparent in
               earlier work: direct gradient analysis, reduction in
               dimensionality and path-seeking (catenation) (Dale 1975).
               Modifications of simple initial techniques made them more
               efficient at the cost of increased computation. Acceptance of
               heavier computation as computers increased in capacity and speed
               turned attention to prineipal component analysis and the
               superficially similar factor analysis. These have been widely
               misunderstood largely because they were initially applied in the
               same way as in the analysis of psychological data, in which
               different constraints and objectives apply. The initial failure
               to recognise that principal component analysis involves a
               preliminary data transformation, the form of which depends on
               answers to biological, not mathematical, questions, was
               particularly unfortunate. Principal component analysis has
               limitations as a technique of ordination resulting from its
               assumptions of linearity and additivity of plant responses.
               Attempts to devise more effective techniques raise questions
               about the practical importance of non-linearity if the objective
               is data-exploration rather than elucidating the nature of
               species-response curves and about the adequacy of using
               simulated data as test data when we do not know how to simulate
               realistic data. Data-exploration has been more prominent in
               practical uses of ordination but many methodological
               developments have concentrated rather on species-response
               curves. Numerical classification also met obstacles to its
               acceptance additional to a general aversion to numerical
               techniques. The first numerical techniques were presented in the
               context of the relationships of a particular set of data, rather
               than of a generally valid system, which was the more familiar
               concept in non-numerical classification. Both numerical and
               non-numerical classification aim to produce as homogeneous
               groups as possible. The distinctive contribution of numerical
               methods is to allow the data to indicate the most efficient
               criteria of classification; this was an unfamiliar idea. The
               strategy of classification may be either divisive or
               agglomerative and either monothetic or polythetic. Choice of
               strategy in earlier work was not only constrained by
               computational limitation but may also have been influenced by an
               author's previous experience of non-numerical classification. As
               with ordination, the distinction between preliminary data
               transformation and subsequent analysis was at first not
               appreciated. Numerical classification has been influenced by
               parallel numerical developments in formal taxonomy. Because
               objectives and assumptions are not always the same, this
               influence has not been altogether helpful. The limitations of
               real data suggest that developments of technique are at risk of
               becoming too concerned with refinements of methodology.
               Increasingly complex methods and increasing availability of
               programmes for such methods carry the risk that they may be used
               without adequate understanding of what they do.",

               High-throughput sequencing methods enable characterization of

               unprecedented scale. However, insight into microbial community
               composition is limited by our ability to detect patterns in this

              to a deregulated immune response to gut microbiome dysbiosis.
              Cross-sectional studies have revealed microbial signatures for
              different IBD subtypes, including ulcerative colitis, colonic
              Crohn's disease and ileal Crohn's disease. Although IBD is
              dynamic, microbiome studies have primarily focused on single time
              points or a few individuals. Here, we dissect the long-term
              dynamic behaviour of the gut microbiome in IBD and differentiate
              this from normal variation. Microbiomes of IBD subjects fluctuate
              more than those of healthy individuals, based on deviation from a
              newly defined healthy plane (HP). Ileal Crohn's disease subjects

              periodically visited the HP then deviated away from it.
              Inflammation was not directly correlated with distance to the
              healthy plane, but there was some correlation between observed
              dramatic fluctuations in the gut microbiome and intensified

              of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch
              length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one
              environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to
              determine whether communities are significantly different, to
              compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and
              ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions
              of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to
              similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of
              UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from
              cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine
              sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured
              isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and
              environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental
              clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical
              location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community
              differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic;
              and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially
              impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm
              oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater
              samples are not more similar to each other than to those in
              sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac
              provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using
              the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows

              However, these aims are often complicated by difficulties
              stemming from high-dimensionality, non-normality, sparsity, and
              the compositional nature of microbiome data sets. A key tool in
              microbiome analysis is beta diversity, defined by the distances
              between microbial samples. Many different distance metrics have
              been proposed, all with varying discriminatory power on data with
              differing characteristics. Here, we propose a compositional beta
              diversity metric rooted in a centered log-ratio transformation
              and matrix completion called robust Aitchison PCA. We demonstrate
              the benefits of compositional transformations upstream of beta
              diversity calculations through simulations. Additionally, we
              demonstrate improved effect size, classification accuracy, and
              robustness to sequencing depth over the current methods on
              several decreased sample subsets of real microbiome data sets.
              Finally, we highlight the ability of this new beta diversity
              metric to retain the feature loadings linked to sample
              ordinations revealing salient intercommunity niche feature
              importance. By accounting for the sparse compositional nature of
              microbiome data sets, robust Aitchison PCA can yield high
              discriminatory power and salient feature ranking between
              microbial niches. The software to perform this analysis is

  author   = "Chang, Qin and Luan, Yihui and Sun, Fengzhu",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Beta diversity, which involves the assessment of
              differences between communities, is an important problem in
              ecological studies. Many statistical methods have been developed
              to quantify beta diversity, and among them, UniFrac and
              weighted-UniFrac (W-UniFrac) are widely used. The W-UniFrac is a
              weighted sum of branch lengths in a phylogenetic tree of the
              sequences from the communities. However, W-UniFrac does not
              consider the variation of the weights under random sampling
              resulting in less power detecting the differences between
              communities. RESULTS: We develop a new statistic termed variance
              adjusted weighted UniFrac (VAW-UniFrac) to compare two
              communities based on the phylogenetic relationships of the
              individuals. The VAW-UniFrac is used to test if the two
              communities are different. To test the power of VAW-UniFrac, we
              first ran a series of simulations which revealed that it always
              outperforms W-UniFrac, as well as UniFrac when the individuals
              are not uniformly distributed. Next, all three methods were
              applied to analyze three large 16S rRNA sequence collections,
              including human skin bacteria, mouse gut microbial communities,
              microbial communities from hypersaline soil and sediments, and a
              tropical forest census data. Both simulations and applications to
              real data show that VAW-UniFrac can satisfactorily measure
              differences between communities, considering not only the species
              composition but also abundance information. CONCLUSIONS:
              VAW-UniFrac can recover biological insights that cannot be
              revealed by other beta diversity measures, and it provides a
              novel alternative for comparing communities.",

              successfully applied to a variety of fields. In recent years, it
              has also received increasing attention for classification and

              classification approach for compositional microbiome data, which
              enabled us to build classifiers and classify new samples in the
              reduced dimensional space produced by t-SNE. The Aitchison
              distance was employed to modify the conditional probabilities in
              t-SNE to account for the compositionality of microbiome data. To
              classify a new sample, its low-dimensional features were obtained
              as the weighted mean vector of its nearest neighbors in the
              training set. Using the low-dimensional features as input, three
              commonly used machine learning algorithms, logistic regression

               microbiome may be playing a role in disease progression, yet
               current studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine
               potential confounders in COVID-19 respiratory microbiome studies
               by analyzing the upper (n = 58) and lower (n = 35) respiratory
               tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and
               controls combining microbiome sequencing, viral load
               determination, and immunoprofiling. We find that time in the
               intensive care unit and type of oxygen support, as well as
               associated treatments such as antibiotic usage, explain the most
               variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, while
               SARS-CoV-2 viral load has a reduced impact. Specifically,
               mechanical ventilation is linked to altered community structure
               and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with
               COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomics of the lower respiratory
               tract of COVID-19 patients identifies specific oral bacteria in
               physical association with proinflammatory immune cells, which
               show higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our
               findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results
               in current COVID-19 microbiome studies and careful attention
               needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen support, as

               marker-gene sequencing data without resorting to the customary
               construction of molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs):
               clusters of sequencing reads that differ by less than a fixed
               dissimilarity threshold. New methods control errors sufficiently
               such that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved
               exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over
               the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer resolution are
               immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused
               on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more
               important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status of
               ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning
               identified independently from a reference database. Here we
               discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of
               closed-reference OTUs---including computational costs that scale
               linearly with study size, simple merging between independently
               processed data sets, and forward prediction---and of de novo
               OTUs---including accurate measurement of diversity and
               applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference
               databases. We argue that the improvements in reusability,
               reproducibility and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great

              disease and health. Identification of factors that affect the
              microbiome composition can provide insights into disease
              mechanism as well as suggest ways to modulate the microbiome
              composition for therapeutical purposes. Distance-based
              statistical tests have been applied to test the association of
              microbiome composition with environmental or biological
              covariates. The unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances are the
              most widely used distance measures. However, these two measures
              assign too much weight either to rare lineages or to most
              abundant lineages, which can lead to loss of power when the
              important composition change occurs in moderately abundant
              lineages. RESULTS: We develop generalized UniFrac distances that
              extend the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances for
              detecting a much wider range of biologically relevant changes. We
              evaluate the use of generalized UniFrac distances in associating
              microbiome composition with environmental covariates using
              extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that tests
              using the unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances are less
              powerful in detecting abundance change in moderately abundant
              lineages. In contrast, the generalized UniFrac distance is most
              powerful in detecting such changes, yet it retains nearly all its
              power for detecting rare and highly abundant lineages. The
              generalized UniFrac distance also has an overall better power
              than the joint use of unweighted/weighted UniFrac distances.
              Application to two real microbiome datasets has demonstrated
              gains in power in testing the associations between human

               individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy
               habitats such as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this
               diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host
               genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated.
               Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated
               microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed
               the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body
               habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each
               habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy
               subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among
               individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81--99\% of
               the genera, enzyme families and community configurations
               occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage

               proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways

  abstract  = "As long ago as 1897 Karl Pearson, in a now classic paper on
               spurious correlation, first pointed out dangers that may befall
               the analyst who attempts to interpret correlations between
               ratios whose numerators and denominators contain common parts.
               He thus implied that the analysis of compositional data, with
               its concentration on relation ships between proportions of some
               whole, is likely to be fraught with difficulty. History has
               proved him correct: over the succeeding years and indeed right
               up to the present day, there has been no other form of data
               analysis where more confusion has reigned and where more
               improper and inadequate statistical methods have been applied.
               The special and intrinsic feature of compositional data is that
               the proportions of a composition are naturally subject to a
               unit-sum constraint. For other forms of constrained data, in
               particular for directional data where there is a unit-length
               constraint on each direction vector, scientist and statistician
               alike have readily appre ciated that new statistical methods,
               appropriate to the special nature of the data, are required; and
               there now exists an extensive literature on the successful
               statistical analysis of directional data. It is paradox ical
               that for compositional data, subject to an apparently simpler
               constraint, such an appreciation and development have been
               slower to emerge. In applications the unit-sum constraint has
               been widely ignored or wished away and inappropriate 'standard'
               statistical methods, devised for and successfully applied to
               unconstrained data, have been used with disastrous consequences.",

              project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these

              we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the
              object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census
              data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common

              is important but requires appropriate statistical methodology.
              When comparing two or more populations most existing approaches
              either discount the underlying compositional structure in the
              microbiome data or use probability models such as the multinomial
              and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, which may impose a
              correlation structure not suitable for microbiome data.
              OBJECTIVE: To develop a methodology that accounts for
              compositional constraints to reduce false discoveries in
              detecting differentially abundant taxa at an ecosystem level,
              while maintaining high statistical power. METHODS: We introduced
              a novel statistical framework called analysis of composition of
              microbiomes (ANCOM). ANCOM accounts for the underlying structure
              in the data and can be used for comparing the composition of
              microbiomes in two or more populations. ANCOM makes no
              distributional assumptions and can be implemented in a linear

              longitudinal data. ANCOM also scales well to compare samples

              of ANCOM to the standard t-test and a recently published
              methodology called Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG) methodology (1)
              for drawing inferences on the mean taxa abundance in two or more
              populations. ANCOM controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at
              the desired nominal level while also improving power, whereas the
              t-test and ZIG had inflated FDRs, in some instances as high as
              68\% for the t-test and 60\% for ZIG. We illustrate the
              performance of ANCOM using two publicly available microbial
              datasets in the human gut, demonstrating its general
              applicability to testing hypotheses about compositional
              differences in microbial communities. CONCLUSION: Accounting for

              significantly improved inference in microbiota survey data.",

  abstract  = "The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is a foundation
               species providing significant ecosystem services. However, the
               roles of oyster microbiomes have not been integrated into any of
               the services, particularly nitrogen removal through
               denitrification. We investigated the composition and
               denitrification potential of oyster microbiomes with an approach
               that combined 16S rRNA gene analysis, metabolic inference, qPCR
               of the nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ), and N2 flux
               measurements. Microbiomes of the oyster digestive gland, the
               oyster shell, and sediments adjacent to the oyster reef were
               examined based on next generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S rRNA
               gene amplicons. Denitrification potentials of the microbiomes
               were determined by metabolic inferences using a customized
               denitrification gene and genome database with the paprica
               (PAthway PRediction by phylogenetIC plAcement) bioinformatics
               pipeline. Denitrification genes examined included nitrite
               reductase (nirS and nirK) and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ),
               which was further subdivided by genotype into clade I (nosZI) or
               clade II (nosZII). Continuous flow through experiments measuring
               N2 fluxes were conducted with the oysters, shells, and sediments
               to compare denitrification activities. Paprica properly
               classified the composition of microbiomes, showing similar
               classification results from Silva, Greengenes and RDP databases.
               Microbiomes of the oyster digestive glands and shells were quite
               different from each other and from the sediments. The relative
               abundance of denitrifying bacteria inferred by paprica was
               higher in oysters and shells than in sediments suggesting that
               oysters act as hotspots for denitrification in the marine
               environment. Similarly, the inferred nosZI gene abundances were
               also higher in the oyster and shell microbiomes than in the
               sediment microbiome. Gene abundances for nosZI were verified
               with qPCR of nosZI genes, which showed a significant positive
               correlation (F1,7 = 14.7, p = 6.0x10-3, R2 = 0.68). N2 flux
               rates were significantly higher in the oyster (364.4 $\pm$ 23.5
               $\mu$mol N-N2 m-2 h-1) and oyster shell (355.3 $\pm$ 6.4
               $\mu$mol N-N2 m-2 h-1) compared to the sediment (270.5 $\pm$
               20.1 $\mu$mol N-N2 m-2 h-1). Thus, bacteria carrying nosZI genes
               were found to be an important denitrifier, facilitating nitrogen
               removal in oyster reefs. In addition, this is the first study to
               validate the use of 16S gene based metabolic inference as a
               method for determining microbiome function, such as

              aged 21 to 65, with BMIs of 18 to 36, were randomized, after a
              two-week baseline diet, to high (15\% total energy [E])- or low
              (7\%E)-saturated-fat groups and randomly received three diets
              (four weeks each) in which the protein source (25\%E) was mainly

              Taxonomic characterization using 16S ribosomal DNA was performed
              on fecal samples collected at each diet completion.
              Interindividual differences in age, body fat (\%), height,
              ethnicity, sex, and alpha diversity (Shannon) were all
              significant factors, and most samples clustered by participant in
              the PCoA ordination. The dietary interventions did not
              significantly alter the overall microbiome community in
              ordination space, but there was an effect on taxon abundance
              levels. Saturated fat had a greater effect than protein source on
              taxon differential abundance, but protein source had a
              significant effect once the fat influence was removed. Higher
              alpha diversity predicted lower beta diversity between the
              experimental and baseline diets, indicating greater resistance to
              change in people with higher microbiome diversity. Our results
              suggest that interindividual differences outweighed the influence
              of these specific dietary changes on the microbiome and that
              moderate changes in saturated fat level and protein source
              correspond to modest changes in the microbiome. The microbiome
              has proven to influence health and disease, but how combinations
              of external factors affect the microbiome is relatively unknown.
              Diet can cause changes, but this is usually achieved by altering
              macronutrient ratios and has not focused on dietary protein
              source or saturated fat intake levels. In addition, each
              individual's unique microbiome profile can be an important factor
              during studies, and it has even been shown to affect therapeutic
              outcomes. We show here that the effects of individual differences
              outweighed the effect of experimental diets and that protein
              source is less influential than saturated fat level. This
              suggests that fat and protein composition, separate from
              macronutrient ratio and carbohydrate composition, is an important
              consideration in dietary studies.",

               recognition and formulation to analytic treatment and
               computational solution. Due to the emphasis upon ideas and

               composition to recapitulate expected patterns of composition and
               metabolic function for carnivorous and herbivorous mammals. The
               animal-based diet was associated with higher levels of
               bile-tolerant microorganisms, including the bacterium Bilophila
               wadsworthia, which has previously been linked to inflammatory
               bowel disease. The authors also detected intact foodborne fungi,
               bacteria and viruses in the distal gut. Long-term dietary intake
               influences the structure and activity of the trillions of
               microorganisms residing in the human gut1,2,3,4,5, but it
               remains unclear how rapidly and reproducibly the human gut
               microbiome responds to short-term macronutrient change. Here we
               show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely
               of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure
               and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial gene
               expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of
               bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and
               Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that
               metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium
               rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored
               differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals2,
               reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein
               fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently
               colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses.
               Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of Bilophila
               wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between
               dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms
               capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease6. In concert,
               these results demonstrate that the gut microbiome can rapidly
               respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the diversity
               of human dietary lifestyles.",

              the abundance of bacterial species or Operational Taxonomic Units

              organized in contingency tables with OTU counts across
              heterogeneous biological samples. In the microbial ecology
              community, ordination methods are frequently used to investigate
              latent factors or clusters that capture and describe variations
              of OTU counts across biological samples. It remains important to
              evaluate how uncertainty in estimates of each biological sample's
              microbial distribution propagates to ordination analyses,
              including visualization of clusters and projections of biological
              samples on low dimensional spaces. We propose a Bayesian analysis
              for dependent distributions to endow frequently used ordinations
              with estimates of uncertainty. A Bayesian nonparametric prior for
              dependent normalized random measures is constructed, which is
              marginally equivalent to the normalized generalized Gamma
              process, a well-known prior for nonparametric analyses. In our
              prior, the dependence and similarity between microbial
              distributions is represented by latent factors that concentrate
              in a low dimensional space. We use a shrinkage prior to tune the
              dimensionality of the latent factors. The resulting posterior
              samples of model parameters can be used to evaluate uncertainty
              in analyses routinely applied in microbiome studies.
              Specifically, by combining them with multivariate data analysis
              techniques we can visualize credible regions in ecological

               is difficult to imagine that the statistical analysis of
               compositional data has been a major issue of concern for more
               than 100 years. It is even more difficult to realize that so
               many statisticians and users of statistics are unaware of the
               particular problems affecting compositional data, as well as
               their solutions. The issue of spurious correlation'', as the
               situation was phrased by Karl Pearson back in 1897, affects all
               data that measures parts of some whole, such as percentages,
               proportions, ppm and ppb. Such measurements are present in all
               fields of science, ranging from geology, biology, environmental
               sciences, forensic sciences, medicine and hydrology. This book
               presents the history and development of compositional data
               analysis along with Aitchison's log-ratio approach.
               ``Compositional Data Analysis'' describes the state of the art
               both in theoretical fields as well as applications in the
               different fields of science. Key Features: - Reflects the
               state-of-the-art in compositional data analysis. - Gives an
               overview of the historical development of compositional data
               analysis, as well as basic concepts and procedures. - Looks at
               advances in algebra and calculus on the simplex. - Presents
               applications in different fields of science, including,
               genomics, ecology, biology, geochemistry, planetology, chemistry
               and economics. - Explores connections to correspondence analysis

              disease is of clinical interest. This work aims to correlate the
              dynamics of gut microbiota with the evolution of children who
              were suffering from acute infectious diarrhea caused by a
              rotavirus, and their recovery after the administration of a
              probiotic, CNCM I-745. The experiment involved 10 children with
              acute infectious diarrhea caused by a rotavirus, and six healthy
              children, all aged between 3 and 4 years. The children who
              suffered the rotavirus infection received CNCM I-745 twice daily
              for the first 5 days of the experiment. Fecal samples were
              collected from each participant at 0, 3, 5, 10, and 30 days after
              probiotic administration. Microbial composition was characterized
              by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity were
              calculated, along with dynamical analysis based on Taylor's law
              to assess the temporal stability of the microbiota. All children
              infected with the rotavirus stopped having diarrhea at day 3
              after the intervention. We observed low alpha diversities in the
              first 5 days (-value < 0.05, Wilcoxon test), larger at 10 and 30
              days after probiotic treatment. Canonical correspondence analysis

              first days (-value < 0.05, ADONIS test), but not in the last days
              of the experiment. Temporal variability was larger in children
              infected with the rotavirus than in healthy ones. In particular,
              class was found to be abundant in children with acute diarrhea.
              We identified the microbiota transition from a diseased state to
              a healthy one with time, whose characterization may lead to
              relevant clinical data. This work highlights the importance of

              concern in environmental microbiology. There are two general
              approaches for measuring community diversity: quantitative
              measures, which use the abundance of each taxon, and qualitative
              measures, which use only the presence/absence of data.
              Quantitative measures are ideally suited to revealing community
              differences that are due to changes in relative taxon abundance
              (e.g., when a particular set of taxa flourish because a limiting
              nutrient source becomes abundant). Qualitative measures are most
              informative when communities differ primarily by what can live in
              them (e.g., at high temperatures), in part because abundance
              information can obscure significant patterns of variation in
              which taxa are present. We illustrate these principles using two
              16S rRNA-based surveys of microbial populations and two
              phylogenetic measures of community beta diversity: unweighted
              UniFrac, a qualitative measure, and weighted UniFrac, a new
              quantitative measure, which we have added to the UniFrac website
              (http://bmf.colorado.edu/unifrac). These studies considered the
              relative influences of mineral chemistry, temperature, and
              geography on microbial community composition in acidic thermal
              springs in Yellowstone National Park and the influences of
              obesity and kinship on microbial community composition in the
              mouse gut. We show that applying qualitative and quantitative
              measures to the same data set can lead to dramatically different
              conclusions about the main factors that structure microbial
              diversity and can provide insight into the nature of community
              differences. We also demonstrate that both weighted and
              unweighted UniFrac measurements are robust to the methods used to
              build the underlying phylogeny.",

               is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently
               historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple
               proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to
               use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches
               are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant
               species. Well-established statistical theory is available that
               simultaneously accounts for library size differences and
               biological variability using an appropriate mixture model.
               Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count
               data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are
               already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR
               and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory
               and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate
               substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model
               framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both
               proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false
               positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant
               across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise
               clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often
               discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative
               methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods
               with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture,
               implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that
               metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of
               biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher
               false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established
               statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid
               rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific

              deoxy-ribonucliec acid (DNA) sequencing is frequently used in
              quantitative molecular assays. Due to properties inherent to the
              sequencing process, unnormalized count data is compositional,
              measuring relative and not absolute abundances of the assayed
              features. This compositional bias confounds inference of absolute
              abundances. Commonly used count data normalization approaches
              like library size scaling/rarefaction/subsampling cannot correct
              for compositional or any other relevant technical bias that is

              sparse metagenomic 16S count data and propose an empirical Bayes
              normalization approach to overcome this problem. In addition, we
              clarify the assumptions underlying frequently used scaling
              normalization methods in light of compositional bias, including
              scaling methods that were not designed directly to address it.
              CONCLUSIONS: Compositional bias, induced by the sequencing
              machine, confounds inferences of absolute abundances. We present
              a normalization technique for compositional bias correction in
              sparse sequencing count data, and demonstrate its improved
              performance in metagenomic 16s survey data. Based on the
              distribution of technical bias estimates arising from several
              publicly available large scale 16s count datasets, we argue that
              detailed experiments specifically addressing the influence of
              compositional bias in metagenomics are needed.",

              and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy

              in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient.
              In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in
              abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community
              assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial
              succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of
              $\approx$ 500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples
              revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes

              cost-effective method for precisely characterizing species and
              genes in such communities. While deep whole-metagenome shotgun
              (WMS) sequencing provides high taxonomic and functional
              resolution, it is often prohibitively expensive for large-scale
              studies. The prevailing alternative, 16S rRNA gene amplicon (16S)
              sequencing, often does not resolve taxonomy past the genus level
              and provides only moderately accurate predictions of the
              functional profile; thus, there is currently no widely accepted
              approach to affordable, high-resolution, taxonomic, and
              functional microbiome analysis. To address this technology gap,
              we evaluated the information content of shallow shotgun
              sequencing with as low as 0.5 million sequences per sample as an
              alternative to 16S sequencing for large human microbiome studies.
              We describe a library preparation protocol enabling shallow
              shotgun sequencing at approximately the same per-sample cost as
              16S sequencing. We analyzed multiple real and simulated
              biological data sets, including two novel human stool samples
              with ultradeep sequencing of 2.5 billion sequences per sample,
              and found that shallow shotgun sequencing recovers more-accurate
              species-level taxonomic and functional profiles of the human
              microbiome than 16S sequencing. We discuss the inherent
              limitations of shallow shotgun sequencing and note that 16S
              sequencing remains a valuable and important method for taxonomic
              profiling of novel environments. Although deep WMS sequencing
              remains the gold standard for high-resolution microbiome
              analysis, we recommend that researchers consider shallow shotgun
              sequencing as a useful alternative to 16S sequencing for
              large-scale human microbiome research studies where WMS
              sequencing may be cost-prohibitive. A common refrain in recent
              microbiome-related academic meetings is that the field needs to
              move away from broad taxonomic surveys using 16S sequencing and
              toward more powerful longitudinal studies using shotgun
              sequencing. However, performing deep shotgun sequencing in large
              longitudinal studies remains prohibitively expensive for all but
              the most well-funded research labs and consortia, which leads
              many researchers to choose 16S sequencing for large studies,
              followed by deep shotgun sequencing on a subset of targeted
              samples. Here, we show that shallow- or moderate-depth shotgun
              sequencing may be used by researchers to obtain species-level
              taxonomic and functional data at approximately the same cost as
              amplicon sequencing. While shallow shotgun sequencing is not
              intended to replace deep shotgun sequencing for strain-level
              characterization, we recommend that microbiome scientists
              consider using shallow shotgun sequencing instead of 16S
              sequencing for large-scale human microbiome studies.",

              microbiota. However, patterns of gut microbiome dysbiosis in IBD
              patients are inconsistent among published studies. Using samples
              from multiple gastrointestinal locations collected prior to
              treatment in new-onset cases, we studied the microbiome in the
              largest pediatric CD cohort to date. An axis defined by an
              increased abundance in bacteria which include Enterobacteriaceae,
              Pasteurellacaea, Veillonellaceae, and Fusobacteriaceae, and
              decreased abundance in Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, and
              Clostridiales, correlates strongly with disease status.
              Microbiome comparison between CD patients with and without
              antibiotic exposure indicates that antibiotic use amplifies the
              microbial dysbiosis associated with CD. Comparing the microbial
              signatures between the ileum, the rectum, and fecal samples
              indicates that at this early stage of disease, assessing the
              rectal mucosal-associated microbiome offers unique potential for
              convenient and early diagnosis of CD.",

              intestinal tract. Although several lines of reasoning suggest
              that gastrointestinal (GI) microbes influence inflammatory bowel

              Specimens were obtained through surgery from a variety of

              to unravel this phenomenon and simplify interpretation. Here, we
              provide evidence that horseshoes arise as a consequence of
              distance metrics that saturate-a familiar concept in other fields
              but new to microbial ecology. This saturation property loses
              information about community dissimilarity, simply because it
              cannot discriminate between samples that do not share any common
              features. The phenomenon illuminates niche differentiation in
              microbial communities and indicates species turnover along

              length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one
              environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to
              determine whether communities are significantly different, to
              compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and
              ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions
              of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to
              similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of
              UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from
              cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine
              sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured
              isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and
              environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental
              clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical

              but the inherent noise in PCR and DNA sequencing limits
              differentiation of closely related bacteria. Although many
              scientific questions can be addressed with broad taxonomic
              profiles, clinical, food safety, and some ecological applications
              require higher specificity. Here we introduce a novel
              sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, Deblur, that uses
              error profiles to obtain putative error-free sequences from
              Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing platforms. Deblur
              substantially reduces computational demands relative to similar
              sOTU methods and does so with similar or better sensitivity and
              specificity. Using simulations, mock mixtures, and real data
              sets, we detected closely related bacterial sequences with single
              nucleotide differences while removing false positives and
              maintaining stability in detection, suggesting that Deblur is
              limited only by read length and diversity within the amplicon
              sequences. Because Deblur operates on a per-sample level, it
              scales to modern data sets and meta-analyses. To highlight
              Deblur's ability to integrate data sets, we include an
              interactive exploration of its application to multiple distinct
              sequencing rounds of the American Gut Project. Deblur is open
              source under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license,
              easily installable, and downloadable from
              https://github.com/biocore/deblur. Deblur provides a rapid and
              sensitive means to assess ecological patterns driven by
              differentiation of closely related taxa. This algorithm provides
              a solution to the problem of identifying real ecological

              association of age, sex, and gut bacterial alpha diversity in
              three large cohorts of adults from four geographical regions:
              subjects from the United States and United Kingdom in the
              American Gut Project (AGP) citizen-science initiative and two
              independent cohorts of Colombians and Chinese. In three of the
              four cohorts, we observed a strong positive association between
              age and alpha diversity in young adults that plateaued after age
              40 years. We also found sex-dependent differences that were more
              pronounced in younger adults than in middle-aged adults, with
              women having higher alpha diversity than men. In contrast to the
              other three cohorts, no association of alpha diversity with age
              or sex was observed in the Chinese cohort. The association of
              alpha diversity with age and sex remained after adjusting for
              cardiometabolic parameters in the Colombian cohort and antibiotic
              usage in the AGP cohort. We further attempted to predict the
              microbiota age in individuals using a machine-learning approach
              for the men and women in each cohort. Consistent with our
              alpha-diversity-based findings, U.S. and U.K. women had a
              significantly higher predicted microbiota age than men, with a
              reduced difference being seen above age 40 years. This difference
              was not observed in the Colombian cohort and was observed only in
              middle-aged Chinese adults. Together, our results provide new
              insights into the influence of age and sex on the biodiversity of
              the human gut microbiota during adulthood while highlighting
              similarities and differences across diverse cohorts.
              Microorganisms in the human gut play a role in health and
              disease, and in adults higher gut biodiversity has been linked to
              better health. Since gut microorganisms may be pivotal in the
              development of microbial therapies, understanding the factors
              that shape gut biodiversity is of utmost interest. We performed
              large-scale analyses of the relationship of age and sex to gut
              bacterial diversity in adult cohorts from four geographic
              regions: the United States, the United Kingdom, Colombia, and
              China. In the U.S., U.K., and Colombian cohorts, bacterial
              biodiversity correlated positively with age in young adults but
              plateaued at about age 40 years, with no positive association
              being found in middle-aged adults. Young, but not middle-aged,
              adult women had higher gut bacterial diversity than men, a
              pattern confirmed via supervised machine learning. Interestingly,
              in the Chinese cohort, minimal associations were observed between
              gut biodiversity and age or sex. Our results highlight the

              This can improve the identification of explanatory factors
              compared to tree-agnostic diversity measures. However, applying
              tree-based diversity measures to metagenome data is more
              challenging than for single-locus sequencing ( e . g ., 16S rRNA
              gene). The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) provides a
              genome-based reference database that can be used for
              species-level metagenome profiling, and a multi-locus phylogeny
              of all genomes that can be employed for diversity calculations.
              This approach also allows for functional diversity measures based
              on genomic content or traits inferred from it. Still, it is
              unclear how metagenome-based assessments of microbiome diversity
              benefit from incorporating phylogeny or function into measures of
              diversity. We assessed this by measuring phylogeny-based,
              function-based, and tree-agnostic diversity measures from a
              large, global collection of human gut metagenomes composed of 33
              studies and 3348 samples. We found tree-based measures to explain
              phenotypic variation ( e . g ., westernization, disease status,
              and gender) better or on par with tree-agnostic measures.
              Ecophylogenetic and functional diversity measures provided unique
              insight into how microbiome diversity was partitioned by
              phenotype. Tree-based measures greatly improved machine learning
              model performance for predicting westernization, disease status,
              and gender, relative to models trained solely on tree-agnostic
              measures. Notably, ecophylogenetic and functional diversity
              measures were generally the most important features for
              predictive performance. Our findings illustrate the usefulness of
              tree- and function-based measures for metagenomic assessments of
              microbial diversity -- a fundamental component of microbiome
              science. Importance Estimations of microbiome diversity are
              fundamental to understanding spatiotemporal changes of microbial
              communities and identifying which factors mediate such changes.
              Tree-based measures of diversity, which consider species
              relatedness, are widespread for amplicon-based microbiome studies
              due to their utility relative to tree-agnostic measures. However,
              tree-based measures are seldomly applied to shotgun metagenomics
              data. We evaluated the utility of phylogeny, functional
              relatedness, and tree-agnostic diversity measures on a large
              scale human gut metagenome dataset to help guide researchers with
              the complex task of evaluating microbiome diversity via

              compositions and to relate microbial features to outcomes.
              However, these aims are often complicated by difficulties
              stemming from high-dimensionality, non-normality, sparsity, and
              the compositional nature of microbiome data sets. A key tool in
              microbiome analysis is beta diversity, defined by the distances
              between microbial samples. Many different distance metrics have
              been proposed, all with varying discriminatory power on data with
              differing characteristics. Here, we propose a compositional beta
              diversity metric rooted in a centered log-ratio transformation
              and matrix completion called robust Aitchison PCA. We demonstrate
              the benefits of compositional transformations upstream of beta
              diversity calculations through simulations. Additionally, we
              demonstrate improved effect size, classification accuracy, and
              robustness to sequencing depth over the current methods on
              several decreased sample subsets of real microbiome data sets.
              Finally, we highlight the ability of this new beta diversity
              metric to retain the feature loadings linked to sample
              ordinations revealing salient intercommunity niche feature

              discriminatory power and salient feature ranking between

              gradients and health gradients in an unstratified cohort of 178
              elderly subjects. To refine our understanding of diet-microbiota
              associations and differential taxon abundance, we adapted an
              iterative bi-clustering algorithm (iterative binary bclustering
              of gene sets (iBBiG)) and applied it to microbiota composition
              data from 732 faecal samples from 371 ELDERMET cohort subjects,
              including longitudinal samples. We thus identified distinctive
              microbiota configurations associated with ageing in both
              community and long-stay residential care elderly subjects.
              Mixed-taxa populations were identified that had clinically
              distinct associations. Microbiota temporal instability was
              observed in both community-dwelling and long-term care subjects,
              particularly in those with low initial microbiota diversity.
              However, the stability of the microbiota of subjects had little
              impact on the directional change of the microbiota as observed
              for long-stay subjects who display a gradual shift away from
              their initial microbiota. This was not observed in
              community-dwelling subjects. This directional change was
              associated with duration in long-stay. Changes in these bacterial
              populations represent the loss of the health-associated and
              youth-associated microbiota components and gain of an elderly
              associated microbiota. Interestingly, community-associated
              microbiota configurations were impacted more by the use of
              antibiotics than the microbiota of individuals in long-term care,
              as the community-associated microbiota showed more loss but also
              more recovery following antibiotic treatment. This improved
              definition of gut microbiota composition patterns in the elderly

              documentation of the factors affecting the microbiome. We
              performed a 2.5-y case study of the assembly of the human infant
              gut microbiome, to relate life events to microbiome composition
              and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy
              infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of
              >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity
              of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes
              in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient.
              In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in
              abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community
              assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial
              succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of
              $\approx$ 500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples
              revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes
              facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes
              involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present before
              the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an
              adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained
              increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short
              chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with
              carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis, and xenobiotic
              degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of
              which are characteristic of the adult microbiome. This study
              revealed that seemingly chaotic shifts in the microbiome are
              associated with life events; however, additional experiments
              ought to be conducted to assess how different infants respond to
              similar life events.",

              pronounced ``biome'') format: a JSON-based file format for
              representing arbitrary observation by sample contingency tables
              with associated sample and observation metadata. As the number of
              categories of comparative omics data types (collectively, the
              ``ome-ome'') grows rapidly, a general format to represent and
              archive this data will facilitate the interoperability of
              existing bioinformatics tools and future meta-analyses. FINDINGS:
              The BIOM file format is supported by an independent open-source
              software project (the biom-format project), which initially
              contains Python objects that support the use and manipulation of
              BIOM data in Python programs, and is intended to be an open
              development effort where developers can submit implementations of
              these objects in other programming languages. CONCLUSIONS: The
              BIOM file format and the biom-format project are steps toward
              reducing the ``bioinformatics bottleneck'' that is currently
              being experienced in diverse areas of biological sciences, and
              will help us move toward the next phase of comparative omics
              where basic science is translated into clinical and environmental
              applications. The BIOM file format is currently recognized as an

               that there is a ``biodiversity crisis'', corresponding to
               extinction rates of species that may be 1000 times what is
               thought to be ``normal''. Biodiversity science has a higher
               profile than ever, with the new Intergovernmental Science-Policy
               Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services involving more
               than 120 countries and 1000s of scientists. At the same time,
               the discipline is re-evaluating its foundations -- including its
               philosophy and even core definitions. The value of biodiversity
               is being debated. In this context, the tree of life
               (``phylogeny'') is emerging as an important way to look at
               biodiversity, with relevance cutting across current areas of
               concern -- from the question of resilience within ecosystems, to
               conservation priorities for globally threatened species -- while
               capturing the values of biodiversity that have been hard to
               quantify, including resilience and maintaining options for
               future generations. This increased appreciation of the
               importance of conserving ``phylogenetic diversity'', from
               microbial communities in the human gut to global threatened
               species, has inevitably resulted in an explosion of new indices,
               methods, and case studies. This book recognizes and responds to
               the timely opportunity for synthesis and sharing experiences in
               practical applications. The book recognizes that the challenge
               of finding a synthesis, and building shared concepts and a
               shared toolbox, requires both an appreciation of the past and a
               look into the future. Thus, the book is organized as a flow from
               history, concepts and philosophy, through to methods and tools,
               and followed by selected case studies. A positive vision and
               plan of action emerges from these chapters, that includes coping
               with inevitable uncertainties, effectively communicating the
               importance of this ``evolutionary heritage'' to the public and
               to policy-makers, and ultimately contributing to biodiversity

  abstract = "We address the problem of Phylogenetic Placement, in which the
              objective is to insert short molecular sequences (called query
              sequences) into an existing phylogenetic tree and alignment on
              full-length sequences for the same gene. Phylogenetic placement
              has the potential to provide information beyond pure ``species
              identification'' (i.e., the association of metagenomic reads to
              existing species), because it can also give information about the
              evolutionary relationships between these query sequences and to
              known species. Approaches for phylogenetic placement have been
              developed that operate in two steps: first, an alignment is
              estimated for each query sequence to the alignment of the
              full-length sequences, and then that alignment is used to find
              the optimal location in the phylogenetic tree for the query
              sequence. Recent methods of this type include HMMALIGN+EPA,
              HMMALIGN+pplacer, and PaPaRa+EPA.We report on a study evaluating
              phylogenetic placement methods on biological and simulated data.
              This study shows that these methods have extremely good accuracy
              and computational tractability under conditions where the input
              contains a highly accurate alignment and tree for the full-length
              sequences, and the set of full-length sequences is sufficiently
              small and not too evolutionarily diverse; however, we also show
              that under other conditions accuracy declines and the
              computational requirements for memory and time exceed acceptable
              limits. We present SEPP, a general ``boosting'' technique to
              improve the accuracy and/or speed of phylogenetic placement
              techniques. The key algorithmic aspect of this booster is a
              dataset decomposition technique in SAT{\'e}, a method that
              utilizes an iterative divide-and-conquer technique to co-estimate
              alignments and trees on large molecular sequence datasets. We
              show that SAT{\'e}-boosting improves HMMALIGN+pplacer, placing
              short sequences more accurately when the set of input sequences
              has a large evolutionary diameter and produces placements of
              comparable accuracy in a fraction of the time for easier cases.

              and nonsaline environments, and the role of pH in driving soil
              microbial compositions. However, our ability to identify the
              specific features of a microbiome that differentiate these
              community-level patterns have lagged behind, especially as
              ever-cheaper DNA sequencing has yielded increasingly large data
              sets. One critical gap is the ability to search for samples that
              contain specific features (for example, sub-operational taxonomic
              units [sOTUs] identified by high-resolution statistical methods
              for removing amplicon sequencing errors). Here we introduce
              redbiom, a microbiome caching layer, which allows users to
              rapidly query samples that contain a given feature, retrieve
              sample data and metadata, and search for samples that match
              specified metadata values or ranges (e.g., all samples with a pH
              of >7), implemented using an in-memory NoSQL database called
              Redis. By default, redbiom allows public anonymous sample access
              for over 100,000 publicly available samples in the Qiita
              database. At over 100,000 samples, the caching server requires
              only 35 GB of resident memory. We highlight how redbiom enables a
              new type of characterization of microbiome samples and provide
              tutorials for using redbiom with QIIME 2. redbiom is open source
              under the BSD license, hosted on GitHub, and can be deployed
              independently of Qiita to enable search of proprietary or
              clinically restricted microbiome databases. Although analyses
              that combine many microbiomes at the whole-community level have
              become routine, searching rapidly for microbiomes that contain a
              particular sequence has remained difficult. The software we
              present here, redbiom, dramatically accelerates this process,
              allowing samples that contain microbiome features to be rapidly
              identified. This is especially useful when taxonomic annotation
              is limited, allowing users to identify environments in which
              unannotated microbes of interest were previously observed. This
              approach also allows environmental or clinical factors that
              correlate with specific features, or vice versa, to be identified
              rapidly, even at a scale of billions of sequences in hundreds of
              thousands of samples. The software is integrated with existing

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Finland has experienced remarkable changes in
              population levels of coronary heart disease risk factors and
              mortality over the past decades. The National FINRISK studies
              have monitored risk factors in major non-communicable diseases
              from 1972 to 2012. The 40-year changes in those risk factors are
              presented. METHODS: Study population included participants aged
              30-59 years in the series on independent random population
              samples. Data were collected in 5-year intervals in 1972-2012.
              FINRISK studies so far comprised 53 589 men and women who
              participated in a health examination, gave a venous blood sample
              and filled in questionnaires. Serum total cholesterol, systolic
              and diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI) were
              measured using standardized protocol, and smoking status was
              recorded. RESULTS: Total serum cholesterol decreased remarkably
              until 2007, but after that has increased. Systolic blood pressure
              has continued to decline over time since 1972, while decrease in
              diastolic blood pressure has levelled off during the last 10
              years. Smoking prevalence has markedly decreased. BMI has
              increased in the population, but most significantly in the
              earlier survey years, not the past 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: After
              three decades of favourable development, the population risk
              factor levels showed some increase in total cholesterol and
              diastolic blood pressure. This emphasizes the need for continued
              efforts towards national disease prevention and health promotion.",

              simultaneous phylogenetic analyses of hundreds of microbial

              limited by the inability to integrate and visualize such vast
              datasets. Fast UniFrac overcomes these issues, allowing
              integration of larger numbers of sequences and samples into a
              single analysis. Its new array-based implementation offers orders
              of magnitude improvements over the original version. New 3D
              visualization of principal coordinates analysis results, with the
              option to view multiple coordinate axes simultaneously, provides
              a powerful way to quickly identify patterns that relate vast

              UniFrac using examples from three data types: Sanger-sequencing
              studies of diverse free-living and animal-associated bacterial
              assemblages and from the gut of obese humans as they diet,
              pyrosequencing data integrated from studies of the human hand and

              deoxy-ribonucliec acid (DNA) sequencing is frequently used in
              quantitative molecular assays. Due to properties inherent to the
              sequencing process, unnormalized count data is compositional,
              measuring relative and not absolute abundances of the assayed
              features. This compositional bias confounds inference of absolute
              abundances. Commonly used count data normalization approaches
              like library size scaling/rarefaction/subsampling cannot correct
              for compositional or any other relevant technical bias that is
              uncorrelated with library size. RESULTS: We demonstrate that
              existing techniques for estimating compositional bias fail with
              sparse metagenomic 16S count data and propose an empirical Bayes
              normalization approach to overcome this problem. In addition, we
              clarify the assumptions underlying frequently used scaling
              normalization methods in light of compositional bias, including
              scaling methods that were not designed directly to address it.
              CONCLUSIONS: Compositional bias, induced by the sequencing
              machine, confounds inferences of absolute abundances. We present
              a normalization technique for compositional bias correction in
              sparse sequencing count data, and demonstrate its improved
              performance in metagenomic 16s survey data. Based on the
              distribution of technical bias estimates arising from several
              publicly available large scale 16s count datasets, we argue that

              the diversity of microbial communities and their relevance to

              sequence variants, this method shows superiority in informing

              Importance Shotgun metagenomics is a powerful, yet
              computationally challenging, technique compared to 16S rRNA gene
              amplicon sequencing for decoding the composition and structure of
              microbial communities. However, current analyses of metagenomic
              data are primarily based on taxonomic classification, which is
              limited in feature resolution compared to 16S rRNA amplicon
              sequence variant analysis. To solve these challenges, we
              introduce Operational Genomic Units (OGUs), which are the
              individual reference genomes derived from sequence alignment
              results, without further assigning them taxonomy. The OGU method
              advances current read-based metagenomics in two dimensions: (i)
              providing maximal resolution of community composition while (ii)
              permitting use of phylogeny-aware tools. Our analysis of
              real-world datasets shows several advantages over currently

              of the digestive tract that affects millions of people worldwide.
              Genetic, environmental and microbial factors have been implicated
              in the onset and exacerbation of IBD. However, the mechanisms
              associating gut microbial dysbioses and aberrant immune responses
              remain largely unknown. The integrative Human Microbiome Project
              seeks to close these gaps by examining the dynamics of microbiome
              functionality in disease by profiling the gut microbiomes of >100
              individuals sampled over a 1-year period. Here, we present the
              first results based on 78 paired faecal metagenomes and
              metatranscriptomes, and 222 additional metagenomes from 59
              patients with Crohn's disease, 34 with ulcerative colitis and 24
              non-IBD control patients. We demonstrate several cases in which
              measures of microbial gene expression in the inflamed gut can be
              informative relative to metagenomic profiles of functional
              potential. First, although many microbial organisms exhibited
              concordant DNA and RNA abundances, we also detected
              species-specific biases in transcriptional activity, revealing
              predominant transcription of pathways by individual
              microorganisms per host (for example, by Faecalibacterium
              prausnitzii). Thus, a loss of these organisms in disease may have
              more far-reaching consequences than suggested by their genomic
              abundances. Furthermore, we identified organisms that were
              metagenomically abundant but inactive or dormant in the gut with
              little or no expression (for example, Dialister invisus). Last,
              certain disease-specific microbial characteristics were more
              pronounced or only detectable at the transcript level, such as
              pathways that were predominantly expressed by different organisms
              in patients with IBD (for example, Bacteroides vulgatus and
              Alistipes putredinis). This provides potential insights into gut
              microbial pathway transcription that can vary over time, inducing
              phenotypical changes that are complementary to those linked to
              metagenomic abundances. The study's results highlight the
              strength of analysing both the activity and the presence of gut
              microorganisms to provide insight into the role of the microbiome
              in IBD.",

              of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch
              length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one
              environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to
              determine whether communities are significantly different, to
              compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and
              ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions
              of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to
              similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of
              UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from
              cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine
              sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured
              isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and
              environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental
              clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical
              location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community
              differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic;
              and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially

              samples are not more similar to each other than to those in

              are to elucidate factors associated with microbial community
              compositions and to relate microbial features to outcomes.
              However, these aims are often complicated by difficulties
              stemming from high-dimensionality, non-normality, sparsity, and
              the compositional nature of microbiome data sets. A key tool in
              microbiome analysis is beta diversity, defined by the distances
              between microbial samples. Many different distance metrics have
              been proposed, all with varying discriminatory power on data with
              differing characteristics. Here, we propose a compositional beta
              diversity metric rooted in a centered log-ratio transformation
              and matrix completion called robust Aitchison PCA. We demonstrate
              the benefits of compositional transformations upstream of beta
              diversity calculations through simulations. Additionally, we
              demonstrate improved effect size, classification accuracy, and
              robustness to sequencing depth over the current methods on
              several decreased sample subsets of real microbiome data sets.
              Finally, we highlight the ability of this new beta diversity
              metric to retain the feature loadings linked to sample
              ordinations revealing salient intercommunity niche feature
              importance. By accounting for the sparse compositional nature of
              microbiome data sets, robust Aitchison PCA can yield high
              discriminatory power and salient feature ranking between

  abstract = "The horseshoe effect is a phenomenon that has long intrigued
              ecologists. The effect was commonly thought to be an artifact of
              dimensionality reduction, and multiple techniques were developed
              to unravel this phenomenon and simplify interpretation. Here, we
              provide evidence that horseshoes arise as a consequence of
              distance metrics that saturate-a familiar concept in other fields
              but new to microbial ecology. This saturation property loses
              information about community dissimilarity, simply because it
              cannot discriminate between samples that do not share any common
              features. The phenomenon illuminates niche differentiation in
              microbial communities and indicates species turnover along
              environmental gradients. Here we propose a rationale for the
              observed horseshoe effect from multiple dimensionality reduction
              techniques applied to simulations, soil samples, and samples from
              postmortem mice. An in-depth understanding of this phenomenon
              allows targeting of niche differentiation patterns from
              high-level ordination plots, which can guide conventional
              statistical tools to pinpoint microbial niches along
              environmental gradients. The horseshoe effect is often considered
              an artifact of dimensionality reduction. We show that this is not
              true in the case for microbiome data and that, in fact,
              horseshoes can help analysts discover microbial niches across

               previously recognized, with a high degree of interindividual
               variability in the composition of bacterial communities. Given
               that skin bacterial communities are personalized, we
               hypothesized that we could use the residual skin bacteria left
               on objects for forensic identification, matching the bacteria on
               the object to the skin-associated bacteria of the individual who
               touched the object. Here we describe a series of studies
               de-monstrating the validity of this approach. We show that
               skin-associated bacteria can be readily recovered from surfaces

               have been left untouched for up to 2 weeks at room temperature.

              Here, we introduce `weighted-nearest neighbor' analysis, an
              unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data
              type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple
              modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of
              hundreds of thousands of human white blood cells alongside a
              panel of 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas

              analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell

              essential to providing clean data for downstream analysis.
              Traditionally, a different tool is used for each operation, such
              as quality control, adapter trimming and quality filtering. These
              tools are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using
              high-level programming languages (e.g. Python and Java) and
              provide limited multi-threading support. Reading and loading data
              multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O
              inefficient. Results: We developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ
              preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering
              features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming,
              quality filtering, per-read quality pruning and many other

              in-depth knowledge of the microbiome by cataloging bacterial,

              advantage over amplicon sequencing approaches that assess
              taxonomy but not function and are taxonomically limited. However,
              mammalian DNA can dominate host-derived samples, obscuring
              changes in microbial populations because few DNA sequence reads
              are from the microbial component. We developed and optimized a
              novel method for enriching microbial DNA from human oral samples
              and compared its efficiency and potential taxonomic bias with
              commercially available kits. RESULTS: Three commercially
              available host depletion kits were directly compared with size
              filtration and a novel method involving osmotic lysis and
              treatment with propidium monoazide (lyPMA) in human saliva
              samples. We evaluated the percentage of shotgun metagenomic
              sequencing reads aligning to the human genome, and taxonomic
              biases of those not aligning, compared to untreated samples.
              lyPMA was the most efficient method of removing host-derived
              sequencing reads compared to untreated sample (8.53 $\pm$ 0.10\%
              versus 89.29 $\pm$ 0.03\%). Furthermore, lyPMA-treated samples
              exhibit the lowest taxonomic bias compared to untreated samples.

              Of many off the shelf platforms explored for speeding up the
              computation process, FPGA stands as the best candidate due to its
              performance per dollar spent and performance per watt. These two

              increases the overall speed-up achieved as well as the price

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Shotgun metagenome data sets of microbial communities
              are highly diverse, not only due to the natural variation of the
              underlying biological systems, but also due to differences in
              laboratory protocols, replicate numbers, and sequencing
              technologies. Accordingly, to effectively assess the performance
              of metagenomic analysis software, a wide range of benchmark data
              sets are required. RESULTS: We describe the CAMISIM microbial
              community and metagenome simulator. The software can model
              different microbial abundance profiles, multi-sample time series,
              and differential abundance studies, includes real and simulated
              strain-level diversity, and generates second- and
              third-generation sequencing data from taxonomic profiles or de
              novo. Gold standards are created for sequence assembly, genome
              binning, taxonomic binning, and taxonomic profiling. CAMSIM
              generated the benchmark data sets of the first CAMI challenge.
              For two simulated multi-sample data sets of the human and mouse
              gut microbiomes, we observed high functional congruence to the
              real data. As further applications, we investigated the effect of
              varying evolutionary genome divergence, sequencing depth, and
              read error profiles on two popular metagenome assemblers,
              MEGAHIT, and metaSPAdes, on several thousand small data sets
              generated with CAMISIM. CONCLUSIONS: CAMISIM can simulate a wide
              variety of microbial communities and metagenome data sets

              reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in
              length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to
              process such data at scale, which presses for the development of
              new alignment algorithms. Results: Minimap2 is a general-purpose
              alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a
              large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of
              $\geq$100 bp in length, $\geq$1 kb genomic reads at error rate

              multi-GPU platforms, using the exact Smith--Waterman (SW)
              algorithm. In the first phase of CUDAlign 4.0, a huge Dynamic
              Programming (DP) matrix is computed by multiple GPUs, which
              asynchronously communicate border elements to the right neighbor
              in order to find the optimal score. After that, the traceback
              phase of SW is executed. The efficient parallelization of the
              traceback phase is very challenging because of the high amount of
              data dependency, which particularly impacts the performance and
              limits the application scalability. In order to obtain a
              multi-GPU highly parallel traceback phase, we propose and
              evaluate a new parallel traceback algorithm called Incremental
              Speculative Traceback (IST), which pipelines the traceback phase,
              speculating incrementally over the values calculated so far,
              producing results in advance. With CUDAlign 4.0, we were able to
              calculate SW matrices with up to 60 Peta cells, obtaining the
              optimal local alignments of all Human and Chimpanzee homologous
              chromosomes, whose sizes range from 26 Millions of Base Pairs

              such comparison was made with the SW exact method. We also show
              that the IST algorithm is able to reduce the traceback time from
              2.15 $\times$ up to 21.03 $\times$ , when compared with the

              synthetic next-generation sequencing reads. This functionality is
              essential for testing and benchmarking tools for next-generation
              sequencing data analysis including read alignment, de novo
              assembly and genetic variation discovery. ART generates simulated
              sequencing reads by emulating the sequencing process with
              built-in, technology-specific read error models and base quality
              value profiles parameterized empirically in large sequencing
              datasets. We currently support all three major commercial
              next-generation sequencing platforms: Roche's 454, Illumina's
              Solexa and Applied Biosystems' SOLiD. ART also allows the
              flexibility to use customized read error model parameters and
              quality profiles. AVAILABILITY: Both source and binary software

              sequence reads or long query sequences against a large reference
              genome such as human. It automatically chooses between local and
              end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs
              chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors
              and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a
              few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better
              performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date.
              Availability and implementation: BWA-MEM is implemented as a

              IGSR represents the largest open collection of human variation

              human variation and by researchers developing analysis methods.
              IGSR has mapped all of the 1000 Genomes sequence to the newest
              human reference (GRCh38), and will release updated variant calls

                 metagenome analysis strategy that directly exploits sequence
                 alignment hits to individual reference genomes as the minimum
                 unit for assessing the diversity of microbial communities and
                 their relevance to environmental factors. This approach is
                 independent from taxonomic classification, granting the
                 possibility of maximal resolution of community composition,
                 and organizes features into an accurate hierarchy using a
                 phylogenomic tree. The outputs are suitable for contemporary
                 analytical protocols for community ecology, differential
                 abundance and supervised learning while supporting
                 phylogenetic methods, such as UniFrac and phylofactorization,
                 that are seldomly applied to shotgun metagenomics despite
                 being prevalent in 16S rRNA gene amplicon studies. As
                 demonstrated in one synthetic and two real-world case studies,
                 the OGU method produces biologically meaningful patterns from
                 microbiome datasets. Such patterns further remain detectable
                 at very low metagenomic sequencing depths. Compared with
                 taxonomic unit-based analyses implemented in currently adopted
                 metagenomics tools, and the analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicon
                 sequence variants, this method shows superiority in informing
                 biologically relevant insights, including stronger correlation
                 with body environment and host sex on the Human Microbiome
                 Project dataset, and more accurate prediction of human age by
                 the gut microbiomes in the Finnish population. We provide
                 Woltka, a bioinformatics tool to implement this method, with
                 full integration with the QIIME 2 package and the Qiita web
                 platform, to facilitate OGU adoption in future metagenomics
                 studies.ImportanceShotgun metagenomics is a powerful, yet
                 computationally challenging, technique compared to 16S rRNA
                 gene amplicon sequencing for decoding the composition and
                 structure of microbial communities. However, current analyses
                 of metagenomic data are primarily based on taxonomic
                 classification, which is limited in feature resolution
                 compared to 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variant analysis. To
                 solve these challenges, we introduce Operational Genomic Units
                 (OGUs), which are the individual reference genomes derived
                 from sequence alignment results, without further assigning
                 them taxonomy. The OGU method advances current read-based
                 metagenomics in two dimensions: (i) providing maximal
                 resolution of community composition while (ii) permitting use
                 of phylogeny-aware tools. Our analysis of real-world datasets
                 shows several advantages over currently adopted metagenomic
                 analysis methods and the finest-grained 16S rRNA analysis
                 methods in predicting biological traits. We thus propose the
                 adoption of OGU as standard practice in metagenomic studies.",
